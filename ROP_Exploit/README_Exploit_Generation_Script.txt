Following are steps to generate Exploit string for Problem2 to encrypt input character string(Uppercase Letters) of any length using Caesar's cipher for key (any value between 1 to 26):

1. Open File "Exploit_Generation_Script_P2.py" in a suitable editor and change variable Input_String to any string of Uppercase letters which you want to encrypt.
2. Also change the value of variable key to any value between 1 to 26 which you want to be the key for encryption
3. Save the file.
2. Run following command in terminal: python Exploit_Generation_Script_P2.py > ExploitStringP2
3. Above command will generate the exploit string for corresponding input string and key you have entered in a file named "ExploitStringP2"
4. Now run the provided executable with the input file/Exploit string generated in previous step with following command:
   ./lab_2_rop < ExploitStringP2
5. Upon running with above command the program will print "ciphertext : 'Encrypted_string'" where 'Encrypted_string' is the encrypted input string
   with provided key in earlier step according to Caesar's cipher described in the Problem after which the program also performs a clean exit.
